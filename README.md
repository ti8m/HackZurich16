## The Conversational Future of Payment

The Aduno Group’s payment interface, Microsoft Cognitive Services for face & voice recognition as provided by Raiffeisen and ti&m’s App «Joy» to recognize shops or things by Estimote Beacons are all at your disposal.

Build the next vending machine or a robot to finally deliver goods. Furthermore we provide some scissors, cardbox and an IoT-kit.

Feel free to use all of this and bring additional tools to build tomorrow’s payment & delivery solution right today!
